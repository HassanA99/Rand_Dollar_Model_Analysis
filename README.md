This repository contains code for building and evaluating models to predict the ZAR/USD exchange rate.

The project explores the relationship between various economic indicators and the South African Rand to US Dollar exchange rate. We employ linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso regression models to predict the exchange rate based on historical data. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis are covered in this project.
